# CoreMLCamera
## A SwiftUI app that uses Apple's CoreML framework to identify the items in front of a camera.

As a beginner in Swift programming, I am introducing my first CoreML app that uses the ResNet model in order to identify the contents put in front of the iPhone's camera, alongside with the procentage of confidence.

Please note that the machine learning associated still needs improvements and time to learn. Training it myself, I got it to achieve higher confidence in ordinary stuff such as fruits.
